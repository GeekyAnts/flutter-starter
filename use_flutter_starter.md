## How to use flutter starter :

To get started with flutter starter:

- Clone the flutter-starter repository from GitHub or click on the use-template button to create an initial template for your project.
- Below is the folder structure of the template that will be created

  [**Folder Structure :**](./folder_structure.md)

- To add an image or any asset there is a folder named assets in the app folder at root location, user can add images under assets/ images/ and if user wants to add google fonts or custom fonts he/ she can create a folder named fonts under assets/
- There are two api-services **dio** and **http** that have been set up for the user if he/ she wants to provide any network method calls**.** We have set up an example of http in the application for signup/ login purposes but user can choose whatever he/ she is comfortable with. User can add more network calls in the respective files as per his/ her use case.
- User can add n amount of colours, font sizes, text theme, etc to maintain the theme of his application.
- User can remove the default UI screens and do a start fresh too and integrate UI as per his/ her requirement.
- Run command `flutter run` to get started ðŸ¥³
